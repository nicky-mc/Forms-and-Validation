## Overview

This application is a simple blog post management system built with React for the frontend and a RESTful API backend. It allows users to create, view, and delete blog posts, as well as categorize them and add tags.

## Features

- View a list of all blog posts
- Create new blog posts
- Delete existing blog posts
- Categorize posts
- Add tags to posts

## Technical Stack

- Frontend: React
- Backend: RESTful API (implementation details not specified)
- API Communication: Fetch API

## Components

### Posts Component

The main component of the application, responsible for rendering the list of posts and the form to create new posts.

#### State

- `posts`: Array of post objects
- `categories`: Array of category objects
- `tags`: Array of tag objects
- `newPost`: Object representing the form data for a new post

#### API Functions

- `fetchPosts()`: Retrieves all posts from the API
- `fetchCategories()`: Retrieves all categories from the API
- `fetchTags()`: Retrieves all tags from the API
- `handleSubmit()`: Handles the submission of a new post
- `handleInputChange()`: Manages form input changes
- `handleDelete()`: Handles the deletion of a post

### API Service

A module that handles all API calls to the backend.

#### Functions

- `getCategories()`: Fetches all categories
- `createCategory()`: Creates a new category
- `getPosts()`: Fetches all posts
- `createPost()`: Creates a new post
- `deletePost()`: Deletes a specific post
- `getTags()`: Fetches all tags
- `createTag()`: Creates a new tag

## Data Flow

1. When the Posts component mounts, it fetches all posts, categories, and tags from the API.
2. Users can view the list of posts, each displaying its title, content, category, and tags.
3. Users can create a new post by filling out the form and selecting a category and tag.
4. When a post is created, the new post is sent to the API, and the post list is refreshed.
5. Users can delete a post by clicking the delete button, which sends a delete request to the API and refreshes the post list.

## Styling

The application uses CSS for styling, with a focus on creating a clean, readable layout for the posts and an intuitive form for creating new posts.

## Future Improvements

- Implement post editing functionality
- Add pagination for the post list
- Implement user authentication and authorization
- Add a rich text editor for post content
- Implement a search feature for posts
